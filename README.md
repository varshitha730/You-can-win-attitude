# You-can-win-attitude
William James of Harvard university said,” The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.”
The foundation of success ,regardless of your chosen field, is attitude .
No one can become success without a good attitude.
Opportunity only knocks once. The next one may be better or worse, but never the same one. That is why it is so crucial to make the right decision at the right time. A right decision at wrong time becomes a wrong decision.
To a positive thinker, attitude can be a stepping-stone to success. To a negative thinker , it can be a stumbling block.
For any company to be successful it should have strong foundation and that is attitude.
